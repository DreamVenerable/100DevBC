//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Now You See Me', 'Your Name', 'Weathering With You']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let first = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let number = movies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let last = movies[ movies.length - 1 ]
